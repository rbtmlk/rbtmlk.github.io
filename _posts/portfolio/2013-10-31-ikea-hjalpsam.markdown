####IKEA HJÄLPSAM
Animated manual for IKEA's HJÄLPSAM home assistant.

This was made for a school project where I wanted to explore alternative rendering techniques in Maya. I imagined what it would look like if IKEA's manuals were animated, in the same simple art style and design language they use. And what a robot sold by IKEA might look like, because I mean come on, you know they will in the future. I'm not really that satisfied with the design of the robot, but given the time I had I'm still pretty happy with the result.

A stereoscopic version was also made which actually turned out pretty cool.

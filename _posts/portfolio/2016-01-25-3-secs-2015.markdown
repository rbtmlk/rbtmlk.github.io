####3 Seconds of Animation [2015]
Daily Challenge: make 3 seconds of animation in 30 minutes, every day.

I managed to keep it up every day for a month or two, then it sort of turned into just once a month...
These are the daily challenge animations I made in 2015.
I had seen a lot of people do a thing every day, like an image or a video, as a daily creative challenge, and I couldn't understand how they had the time or energy to create all those amazing things, every single day.
But then I thought what if I gave myself 30 minutes. 30 minutes a day is something you should be able to make room for, at least most days. 30 minutes to make 3 seconds of animation. Nothing more, nothing less. 3 seconds. 3 seconds of whatever. Just do something. Anything. 
It doesn't have to be amazing, or even good, just as long as I actually did something I thought I might learn a thing or two and maybe once in a while it could even turn into something decent.

It actually turned out to be incredibly rewarding, but I still somehow slowly forgot about it and reverted back to being lazy again...
But this year I really want to pick up the challenge again and make some more stuff.
